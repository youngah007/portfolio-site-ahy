                            Founded in 2012, Carta started by helping private companies manage their cap tables. Since then we have expanded into valuations, investor services and public markets. We now support 7,000+ companies, 400,000+ unique stakeholders, and have valued over $200B in private assets. It is our mission to map the global ownership network for companies, investors, and employees.

                            Carta found product market fit as a great record keeping platform that gave all stakeholders clarity of ownership. Reflecting transactions that happened offline came with its challenges—manual entry was time consuming and introduced mistakes. Furthermore, Carta needed visibility into real-time transactions in order to kick-start a new Capital Markets business that would participate in those transactions. Our strategy was to make closing private market transactions seemless for all parties involved. Updating your cap table would no longer be necessary.
                            <br><br>
                            We started with the transaction that had the highest velocity on Carta. Thousands of employees exercise on Carta every month. A lot needed to happen in order to move this experience away from an internal one-on-one manual process to an automated workflow. Employees needed to <a href="https://blog.carta.com/equity-101-stock-option-basics/" target="_blank">understand their option grant</a>; request how much they want to purchase; sign legal documents; transfer funds to the company; and <a href="https://medium.com/eshares-blog/fixing-the-83-b-problem-fa3f77da4ed6" target="_blank">file important tax forms</a>.

                            Financings on Carta helped companies better manage and close their primary financing rounds. We closed everything from convertible debt rounds to our own <a href="#" target="_blank">$42M Series C round</a>.
                            <br><br>
                            Our latest product was a liquidity platform that helps companies run tender offers at scale. Liquidity is the biggest criticism of a company deciding to stay private for too long. Carta has now run 40+ liquidity events for its largest customers including those with an enterprise value in the billions. Revenue increased 2,500% from 2016 to 2017 while we tested new pricing options.
                            <br><br>
                            All in all we helped move hundreds of millions of dollars through our transactional features and helped seed a successful stand alone liquidity business. It was an incredibly rewarding challenge to lead such a talented team that worked across Legal, Compliance, Data Science, Business Development, Operations, Marketing, Product, and Engineering.

                            Since I joined our product teams had built a ton of product that we werent realizing in revenue. For example, our 3921 feature generates tax forms for every exercise that occurs within a given tax year and helps automtically file those forms with the IRS. This feature saved our customers a ton of time in an otherwise very manual and error prone process. We had six other potential revenue generating features that added value beyond our core cap table management product. This lead us to our next innovation that resulted in revenue growth. We built our own subscription model to manage tiers of growth but also features sets they had access to. If your contract didn’t have a set of features you needed, then you had to upgrade. As a result, our new subscription system not only managed the stakholder tier they were on but it now managed feature sets they could use. This resulted in 10% MoM increase in expansion annual recurring revenue from our existing customer base and 2x ACV in small business and mid-market segments. Total ARR grew 200% YoY for 2016 and 2017.

                            In early 2016 the company <a href="#" target="_blank">reorganized into separate business units</a> since we had just kicked off both an Investor Services and Valuations business to further capture and monetize the network with new products and services. I was appointed Product Trifecta (Head of Product) for the Private Markets business (Formerly named “Corporate”) which is our core cap table management business. With the help of our Business and Engineering Trifectas we managed a business unit of 25 people at its inception to what grew to 150 people when I left that post in July of 2017. I personally managed and mentored seven product team members accross product managment and design roles that contributed to various teams within the business unit. We went through multiple reorganizations and found our groove in a model that focued teams on the customer problem (e.g. Onboarding, Account management and Partnerships) with product, engineering and business members within each team working closely together. Our KPIs continued to focus on growth and health of the network, however we were realizing that our existing pricing model would not grow well with us or our customers. At that time customers were paying $20 for ever security they issued. We had trouble forcasting revenue and our customers could not figure out how much they would pay for our product over a period of time. Furthermore, the $20 per issuance was a poor product experience. We decided to test a subscription model for a period of time while still supporting our transactional pricing model. It was well received and we made the decision to switch all customers to a subscription that year. This was an initiative I personally lobbied for: we needed a better business model for ourselves, our customers deserved a better way to understand and manage their payments for our product, and we had a ton of technical debt around how we charged customers through the product that needed to be cleaned up. Henry, our CEO, directly assigned me to lead this project. We had to explain to all of our customers why we were doing this and why it would be best for them too. We ran an extensive analysis on our entire customer base that helped us determine a tier pricing structure with an understanding of which customer would fit into each teir. We knew if customers would be paying more or less compared to our prior model and we knew which segments of customers were getting the most out of the platfrom based on their size and what the product offered at that point in time. This is an important point. We were able to confidently raise prices in certain customer segments because of our understanding of value that we provided to those segments. We sent personal communications to customers based on these segments. We decided not to grandfather customers into the old pricing model and we ultimately learned that certain groups of customers in specific segments had an unfair result in the transition. We made right by them and gave discounts. I was on the phone for months with customers on this topic which really helped me understand our customers’ perspective of the product. Aside from feedback on the new pricing, these conversations gave incredbile insight into the next wave of problems our product team needed to solve.

                            As our growth started to accelerate, we encountered a new challenge: how to onboard more companies, faster. Historically, only Carta staff was able to onboard new companies. Staff users had a few power tools but the rest was painfully manual. I lead the product team to focus on this problem. Over the course of a couple months we built several tools. Setup mode allowed for an environment with less validation and restrictions so we could quickly get data in. We took our staff Cap table importer and put a well designed interface and workflow around it so it was much easier to use and understand when there were issues or missing pieces of data. We also built an Account check that focused on data quality and raised discrepencies in data issues, made sure the cap table tied out and had you finish certain tasks before “Going live”. We specifically designed these new features to be easy enough for our power users. This allowed us to use armies of paralegals to help onboarding managers onboard cap tables. This created a ton of leverage for us as we were rapidly growing through referals that the network was so great at creating. The succesful adoption of these new features coupled with the well executed shift in internal operations led us double our productivity overnight and dig ourselves out of an ever growing backlog of new customers waiting to be up and running on the platform. Our Series B financing closed at the end of 2015 which was in support of this growth and our ability to execute as a cross-functional technical team in a complicated business.

                            I joined Carta in February 2015 as a product designer. The product team was four people, including myself, and the company was at around 18 people in total. We had only a handful of customers and just closed our <a href="#" target="_blank">Series A financing</a>. At that time our sole focus was on helping private companies <a href="#" target="_blank">better manage their cap tables</a> while also giving investors and employees visibility into their ownership. Upon arrival, I spent my time in front of as many customers and law firms (they are the power user on the platform) to learn about their existing experience with the product and what they needed it to be like. I quickly took the lead role on the product team under our head of product and ran sprints week over week to start building for product market fit. We had a great idea that was not aligned with the market at that point and major product gaps to close in order to bring on the next wave of companies, which ultimately had more complex cap tables. A core metric we measured ourselves by was certificates accepted. This helped us understand how much of the ownership network we were pulling on to the platform month over month. We grew that 10% MoM during that period of time.

                            I can't help but smile when I think back to may first day at Carta. They took a big risk on my not having much relevant experience and I had no idea what I was getting into. The goal for the first day was to ship something into the product. My contribution was a simple icon on the access page that indicated whether or not a user had enabled two-factor authentication. I came a long way since day one—I am so thankful to everyone in the company who helped me grow.
