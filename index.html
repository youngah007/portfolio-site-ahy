                            Welcome, I'm Andrew. I lead technical teams that deliver digital products that people love to use. My focus on problem solving helps drive strategy, while my passion for design helps me stay close to every detail. I'm based in San Francisco and looking for the next big problem to solve.

                            Founded in 2012, Carta started by helping private companies manage their cap tables. Since then we have expanded into valuations, investor services and public markets. We now support 7,000+ companies, 400,000+ unique stakeholders, and have valued over $200B in private assets. It is our mission to map the global ownership network for companies, investors, and employees.

                        <p>
                            Carta found product market fit as a great record keeping platform that gave all stakeholders clarity of ownership. Reflecting transactions that happened offline came with its challenges—manual entry was time consuming and introduced mistakes. Furthermore, Carta needed visibility into real-time transactions in order to kick-start a new Capital Markets business that would participate in those transactions. Our strategy was to make closing private market transactions seemless for all parties involved. Updating your cap table would no longer be necessary.
                            <br><br>
                            We started with the transaction that had the highest velocity on Carta. Employees exercise  option grants thousands of times a month. A lot needed to happen in order to move this experience away from an internal one-on-one manual process to an automated workflow. Employees needed to understand their option grant; request how much they want to purchase; sign legal documents; transfer funds to the company; and file important tax forms.
                            <br><br>
                            Financings on Carta helped companies better manage and close their primary financing rounds. We closed everything from convertible debt rounds to our own <a href="#">$42M Series C round</a>.
                            <br><br>
                            Our latest product was a liquidity platform that helps companies run tender offers at scale. Over the past two years we have run 40+ liquidity events for our largest customers including those with an enterprise value in the billions. Revenue increased 2,500% from 2016 to 2017. (Something about how difficult these can be - reference the Uber deal?)
                            <br><br>
                            All in all we helped move hundreds of millions of dollars through our transactional features and helped seed a successful new liquidity business that had a product that was best in class.
                            <!-- I worked with a new team to focus on this transformation. Coordinating with Legal and Compliance was core building on a solid foundation. We set up a money movement stack with Silicon Valley Bank to support us in moving customers’ funds on the platform.  -->
