                            Carta found product market fit as a record-keeping platform that gave all stakeholders clarity of ownership. Recording transactions that happened offline came with its challenges&mdash;manual entry was time-consuming and introduced mistakes. Furthermore, Carta needed visibility into real-time transactions in order to kick-start a new Capital Markets business that would participate in those transactions. Our strategy was to make closing private market transactions seamless for all parties involved, without the need to update your cap table afterwards.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We started with the transaction that had the highest velocity on Carta: option exercising. We moved this experience away from an internal one-on-one manual process to an automated workflow by helping employees <a href="https://blog.carta.com/equity-101-stock-option-basics/" target="_blank">understand their option grant</a>, view the current details of their options grant (e.g. vesting and fair market value), request how much they want to purchase, sign legal documents, transfer funds to the company, and <a href="https://medium.com/eshares-blog/fixing-the-83-b-problem-fa3f77da4ed6" target="_blank">file important tax forms</a>. As a result, thousands of employees exercise on Carta every month, without companies needing to update their cap table manually.

                        <p>
                            Our successful transition to subscription pricing opened up new opportunities for further revenue growth. During my first two years at Carta, the product teams I was leading had been originating and refining new features alongside our core cap table management. However, customers weren't paying for them because we struggled to price these new features with our transactional pricing model. We wanted to solve this by influencing price beyond stakeholder count&mdash;with features.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our MVP was a simple in-app marketing page that controlled access to our <a href="https://tour.carta.com/corporations/7/tax_center/#o|-year.-created,page|1" target="_blank">Form 3921</a> feature. If you were a first-time user of this feature then you needed to "upgrade" to get access. For the first time, we recorded expansion revenue that wasn't based on stakeholder growth.
                        </p>
                        <img class="center-block shadow" src="/assets/img/3921-paywall.png">

                        </span>
                        <p>
                            We were then ready to pull in all of the standalone features, but we needed a way to manage this across 6,500 customers. <a href="https://stripe.com/" target="_blank">Stripe's</a> plan management fell short, especially since we were still testing price points for various customer segments and needed pricing flexibility per customer based on negotiations. I led our account management team and <a href="https://twitter.com/jaredhobbs?lang=en" target="_blank">Jared Hobbs</a> to build out a subscription plan product that handled flexible pricing tiers based on stakeholder count, while also managing access to features. We then built an in-app experience to market these features and control access to them based on your subscription settings. I also worked on the front lines with the business team to help iterate on the product and business process.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This resulted in <strong>10% MoM increase in expansion annual recurring revenue</strong> from our existing customer base and <strong>2x ACV in small business and mid-market segments</strong>. <strong>Total ARR grew 200% YoY for 2016 and 2017</strong> settling in at <strong>$20M+</strong> by the end of 2017. The growth of these metrics played a critical role in the success of our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/11/eshares-raises-42-million-to-manage-equity-compensation-and-investments/" target="_blank">Series C fundraising</a>.

                        </h6>
                        <p>
                            In early 2016 the company <a href="https://blog.carta.com/founders-wanted/" target="_blank">reorganized into separate business units</a> to build out a new Investor Services and Valuations business. I was promoted to Product Trifecta (Head of Product) for the Private Markets business, which is our core cap table management business. With the help of our Business and Engineering Trifectas we managed a business unit of 25 people at its inception to what grew to 150 people when I left that post in July of 2017. I personally managed and mentored seven product team members across product management and design roles. We went through multiple reorganizations and found our groove in a model that focused teams on the customer problem (e.g. Onboarding, Account management and Partnerships) with product, engineering and business members working in tandem. Our KPIs continued to focus on growth and health of the network, however we were realizing that our existing pricing model was problematic for us and our customers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We originally charged customers $20 for every security they issued. We had trouble forecasting revenue and and it was unclear to our customers how much they would pay for our product over a period of time. After personally lobbying for a better business model and product experience, we decided to test a subscription model for a period of time while still supporting our transactional pricing model. We hit our success metrics in our test and made the decision to switch all customers to a subscription that year&mdash;without grandfathering. Henry, our CEO, directly assigned me to lead this project. We ran an extensive analysis on our entire customer base that helped us determine a tiered pricing structure with an understanding of where each customer would fit in. I then led the technical initiative to implement a new product experience around charging customers based on stakeholder count and a data migration to the new subscription plans in Stripe&mdash;all to be released after communicating to 3,000 paying customers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We explained our reasoning to all of our customers as well as how and why it would benefit them. We sent personalized emails to customers of each pricing segment to best explain the new price point. I was on the phone for months with customers on this topic which really helped me understand our customers’ perspective of the product. Aside from feedback on the new pricing, these conversations gave incredible insight into the next wave of problems our product team needed to solve. As of early July 2016 our core business was entirely subscription revenue.

                            We encountered a new challenge as sign-ups were increasing rapidly month over month: how to onboard more companies faster. At this point, only Carta onboarding managers were able to onboard new companies. Onboarding managers had a few power tools but the rest was painfully manual. Over the course of several months we built an array of tools to ameliorate this process and enable our users to join the onboarding experience in-app. Setup mode allowed for an environment with less validation and restrictions so we could quickly import data. We took our staff Cap table importer and put a well designed interface and workflow around it so it was much easier to use and understand when there were issues or missing pieces of data. Our Account check focused on data quality and raised discrepencies in data issues&mdash;always making sure that the cap table tied out and that you finished the necessary tasks before “going live”.

                                    A main goal of the project was to design these features so the companies' paralegals could help our staff onboard companies. This created leverage for us by using armies of paralegals to help onboarding managers onboard cap tables. The adoption of these new features by paralegals coupled with the well-executed shift in internal operations allowed us to double our productivity. Our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/08/18/eshares-now-valued-at-77-million-looks-far-beyond-silicon-valley-2/" target="_blank">Series B financing</a> closed at the end of 2015 which was in support of this growth and our ability to execute on operational challenges.

                            I joined Carta in February 2015 as a technical product designer. The product team consisted of four people, including myself, and the company had twenty people in total. We had only a handful of customers and had just closed our <a href="https://blog.carta.com/carta-series-a/" target="_blank">Series A financing</a>. At that time our sole focus was helping private companies <a href="#" target="_blank">better manage their cap tables</a> while also giving investors and employees visibility into their ownership. Though we had a great idea, we weren't yet aligned with the market and we had major product gaps to close in order to attract the next wave of companies with more complex cap tables.

                            I spent my time in front of customers and law firms (paralegals are a main power user on the platform) to learn about their experience with the product and report back with new product releases. I ran the company-wide release planning meeting along with our weekly sprints to start building for product-market fit. This resulted in new data models, in-app workflows and reporting. Check out our release notes from the early days <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Andrew-Young-86/all_posts" target="_blank">here</a>.

                            A core metric we measured ourselves by was certificates accepted. This helped us understand how much of the ownership network we were pulling onto the platform month over month. We grew our certificates accepted metric <strong>10% MoM</strong> during that period of time.

                            I can't help but smile when I think back to may first day at Carta. The goal for my first day was to ship new new feature into the product. My contribution was a simple icon on the access page that indicated whether or not a user had enabled two-factor authentication. I have come a long way since my first day at Carta and I am so thankful for all of the wonderful people and challenging opportunities that helped me grow.
