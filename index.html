                                I helped grow the product team from 4 to 25 while serving as Head of Product for the core business. During this time ARR grew from $0 to $20M+.

                                My most recent mission within the company was to shift Carta from a record keeping platform to a transactional platform. Let's start there and work our way back to my first day.

                                Carta found product market fit as a record keeping platform that gave all stakeholders clarity of ownership. Reflecting transactions that happened offline came with its challenges—manual entry was time consuming and introduced mistakes. Furthermore, Carta needed visibility into real-time transactions in order to kick-start a new Capital Markets business that would participate in those transactions. Our strategy was to make closing private market transactions seemless for all parties involved. Updating your cap table would no longer be necessary.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We started with the transaction that had the highest velocity on Carta: option exercising. A lot needed to happen in order to move this experience away from an internal one-on-one manual process to an automated workflow. Employees needed to <a href="https://blog.carta.com/equity-101-stock-option-basics/" target="_blank">understand their option grant</a>; request how much they want to purchase; sign legal documents; transfer funds to the company; and <a href="https://medium.com/eshares-blog/fixing-the-83-b-problem-fa3f77da4ed6" target="_blank">file important tax forms</a>. Now, thousands of employees exercise on Carta every month.

Liquidity is the biggest criticism of a company deciding to stay private for too long. Carta has now <strong>run 40+ liquidity events</strong> for its largest customers including those with an enterprise value in the billions. Revenue increased 2,500% from 2016 to 2017 while we tested new pricing options.

                                Our successful transition to subscription pricing opened up new opportunities for further revenue growth. Over the past two years our product teams had been originating and refining new features that we weren't realzing in revenue because we struggled to price them in with our transactional pricing model. We wanted to see if we could influence price beyond stakeholder count&mdash;with features.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Our MVP was a simple in app marketing page that controled access to our <a href="https://tour.carta.com/corporations/7/tax_center/#o|-year.-created,page|1" target="_blank">Form 3921</a> feature. If you were a first time user of this feature then you needed to "upgrade" to get access. For the first time, we recorded expansion revenue that wasn't based on stakeholder growth&mdash;and it was a significant amount.
                            </p>
                            <img class="center-block shadow" src="/assets/img/3921-paywall.png">

                            <p>
                                We were now ready to pull in all of the stand alone features, but we needed a way to manage this across 6,500 customers. <a href="https://stripe.com/" target="_blank">Stripe's</a> plan management fell short, espcially since we were still testing price points for various customer segments and needed pricing flexibility per customer based on negotiations. <a href="https://twitter.com/jaredhobbs?lang=en" target="_blank">Jared Hobbs</a> and the account management team built a subscription plan product that handled flexible pricing tiers based on stakeholder count, while also managing access to features. We then built an in app experience to market these features and control access to them based on your subscription settings. All in all, this was a big coordination effort internally to make sure the front lines of the business had the proper tools they needed to make this model succesful.

                            <p>
                                In early 2016 the company <a href="https://blog.carta.com/founders-wanted/" target="_blank">reorganized into separate business units</a> to build out a new Investor Services and Valuations business. I was now in the role of Product Trifecta (Head of Product) for the Private Markets business&mdash;our core cap table management business. With the help of our Business and Engineering Trifectas we managed a business unit of 25 people at its inception to what grew to 150 people when I left that post in July of 2017. I personally managed and mentored seven product team members accross product managment and design roles. We went through multiple reorganizations and found our groove in a model that focued teams on the customer problem (e.g. Onboarding, Account management and Partnerships) with product, engineering and business members within each team working closely together. Our KPIs continued to focus on growth and health of the network, however we were realizing that our existing pricing model would not grow well with us or our customers.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                At that time customers were paying $20 for ever security they issued. We had trouble forcasting revenue and our customers could not figure out how much they would pay for our product over a period of time. After personally lobying for a better business model and product experience, we decided to test a subscription model for a period of time while still supporting our transactional pricing model. It was well received and we made the decision to switch all customers to a subscription that year&mdash;without grandfathering. Henry, our CEO, directly assigned me to lead this project. We had to explain to all of our customers why we were doing this and why it would be best for them too. We ran an extensive analysis on our entire customer base that helped us determine a tier pricing structure with an understanding of which customer would fit into each teir. We knew if customers would be paying more or less compared to our prior model and we knew which segments of customers were getting the most out of the platfrom based on their size and what the product offered at that point in time. We sent personal communications to customers based on these segments. Throughout the transition we learned that customers in specific segments had an unfair result. We made right by them and gave discounts after countless customer conversations. I was on the phone for months with customers on this topic which really helped me understand our customers’ perspective of the product. Aside from feedback on the new pricing, these conversations gave incredbile insight into the next wave of problems our product team needed to solve.

                                As of early July 2016 our core business was exclusively subscription revenue.

                                We encountered new challenge as sign ups were increasing rapidly month over month: how to onboard more companies, faster. At this point, only Carta staff was able to onboard new companies. Staff users had a few power tools but the rest was painfully manual. Over the course of a couple months we built several tools. Setup mode allowed for an environment with less validation and restrictions so we could quickly get data in. We took our staff Cap table importer and put a well designed interface and workflow around it so it was much easier to use and understand when there were issues or missing pieces of data. Our Account check focused on data quality and raised discrepencies in data issues&mdash;always making sure the cap table tied out and you finish certain tasks before “Going live”.

                                        A main goal of the project was to design these features so power users could help staff onboard companies. This allowed us to use armies of paralegals to help onboarding managers onboard cap tables. This created a ton of leverage for us as we were rapidly growing through referals. The adoption of these new features by paralegals coupled with the well executed shift in internal operations allowed us to double our productivity. Our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/08/18/eshares-now-valued-at-77-million-looks-far-beyond-silicon-valley-2/" target="_blank">Series B financing</a> closed at the end of 2015 which was in support of this growth and our ability to execute on operational challenges.

                                I joined Carta in February 2015 as a Product Designer. The product team was four people, including myself, and the company was at around 18 people in total. We had only a handful of customers and just closed our <a href="https://blog.carta.com/carta-series-a/" target="_blank">Series A financing</a>. At that time our sole focus was on helping private companies <a href="#" target="_blank">better manage their cap tables</a> while also giving investors and employees visibility into their ownership. We had a great idea that was not aligned with the market at that point and major product gaps to close in order to bring on the next wave of companies with more complex cap tables.

                                I spent my time in front of customers and law firms (paralegals are a main power user on the platform) to learn about their experience with the product and report back with new product releases. I ran company wide release planning along with our weekly sprints to start building for product market fit. This resulted in new data models, in-app workflows and reporting.
